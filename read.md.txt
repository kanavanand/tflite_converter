Conversion to Lite Format




Import all the packages:
* Tensorflow , numpy
* Note : Tensorflow has not yet included all the modules of lite in the recent tensorflow version.
* According to them it will be updated in 1.15 version.


Make a zip file:
* You should have a zip file which contains all the checkpoint files as well as frozen model file(.pb) extension.
* Upload this zip directly into the colab. Take care about the directories where your model is uploaded and update them accordingly in the code.


Names of the tensors:
* Whenever you use the frozen graph we have their input and output tensors which we need to use them in the toco converter.
* So Note: put them very accordingly  during calling the conversion function in main().
* By default I have  put it -'prefix/input_node:0' and 'prefix/output_node:0'  respectively.


Inputs in the conversion function


1. Inputs for the conversion function:
2. img_size_x  = Size of the input tensor.
3. img_size=_y=Size of the input tensor.
4. channels= Number of Channels.
5. direc = path from where we should load all files..
6. frozen_model_pb = frozen graph name
7. checkpoint_path=the complete path and name of the meta file: 
8. The file was-> “CD_Check_k/filename_CD.ckpt.meta”  
9. Give input-  "CD_Check_k/filename_CD.ckpt"
